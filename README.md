## Tech Stack

- Backend: Neo4j and Django
- Frontend: ECharts and React

## Installation and Usage

### Backend

- Install and start the Neo4j database
- APOC can be installed by moving the APOC jar file from the $NEO4J_HOME/labs directory to the $NEO4J_HOME/plugins directory and restarting Neo4j.
- Navigate to the `backend` directory in the terminal and execute the following command to install Python dependencies: 
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Create a new database in the Neo4j database
- Modify the connection parameters of the Neo4j database in the `backend/backend/settings.py` file
- Navigate to the `backend` directory in the terminal and execute the following command to migrate data:
python manage.py migrate

- Execute the following command in the terminal to start the backend server:
`python manage.py runserver`

### Frontend

- Navigate to the `frontend` directory in the terminal and execute the following command to install frontend dependencies:
    ```npm install```

- Modify the address and port of the backend server in the `frontend/src/services` â€˜s files
- Execute the following command in the terminal to start the frontend server:
